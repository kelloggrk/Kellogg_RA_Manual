### Time Tracking
At the end of each day, keep track of your time in Admin/Timesheet.xlsx. This is in addition to whatever official time tracking system you may have through the university.

### Weekly Notes
At the beginning of the project, we should create a GitHub Issue titled "Weekly Notes." Once per week, RA's who are working regularly on the project should post to the Weekly Notes issue, @mentioning all project members, so that we all get notified of the update. Each week's post should contain the following in bullet form:
* **Issues search.** A link to a GitHub Issues search for all open issues that are assigned to you and have not been updated in the past two weeks. The search can be formatted as in this [link](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+assignee%3Alboxell+updated%3A%3C2016-08-05).
* **Last week tasks.** Brief list of what you worked on in the preceding week and summary of key insights/developments,  referencing output files and Issues if helpful. 
 (Note: the Issues threads remain the only task management/discussion threads. The Weekly Note is not a duplicate or substitute.)
* **Schedule**. If we have a schedule, how does progress compare to scheduled progress?
* **Lask week hours.** A count of hours spent on the project in the past week.
* **Discussion.** (Optional) Any additional information to discuss.
* **Assignments to others.** If needed, reminders to others of Issues/tasks that they need to complete, including required completion dates, e.g., @eherrnst additional data X ASAP, @erikylelewis code review Y by 3/25, @kelloggrk you must resolve Issue #42 by 4/3.
* **Next week tasks.** Proposed list of tasks for the next week.
* **Meeting flag.** "Yes" if reason to keep weekly meeting, "No" if we should cancel weekly meeting. If there is a meeting, include a link to the google doc meeting notes.

### Meetings
At least 24 hours in advance of a group meeting, the lead RA should prepare a meeting notes post on Slack that is populated with an agenda and, if efficient, links to any files/results that will be discussed in the meeting. Following the meeting, the RA is in charge of: (1) adding a summary of meeting outcomes and decisions onto the meeting notes post on Slack; and (2) creating and assigning issues as necessary on Github.
